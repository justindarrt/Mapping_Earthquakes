# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to analyze earthquake data. The data is visually displayed using map box in java script, hmtl, and css. There are three different maps the user can select. The website also has built in feature allowing the user to turn off/on three different types of data: all earthquakes, recent earthquakes and tectonic plates.
